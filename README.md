# ManimFourierSeriesVis
A complex Fourier series implemented in Python to trace whatever you draw with your mouse. It uses the Manim library to render. Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k (no code was copied or even looked at)

Below is an example output of the program. To see it at 60 FPS, a higher resolution, and slowed down to take up a minute, please download the examplevideo.mp4 file. The mp4 file shows much more detail in how the disks rotate and the video also looks cooler.
